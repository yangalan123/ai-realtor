        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the
            generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as the focal
            application domain. The method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while
            highlighting useful factual attributes. The agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module,
            mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content
            with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized
            features. Human-subject experiments demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are
            preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin, suggesting a promising LLM-based agentic
            framework to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring responsible generation using only facts.
        </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        While large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, their ability to persuade
        remains an underexplored frontier. This capability is particularly important since persuasion-related economic
        activities underpin roughly $30\%$ of the US GDP, creating tremendous opportunities for applying LLMs across
        various sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        This research studies language generation for <strong>grounded persuasion</strong> — a form of persuasion
        inspired by Aristotle's philosophy that is grounded in fact, tailored to the audience, and adapted to contextual
        factors. Using real estate marketing as a testbed, we construct a realistic evaluation environment to
        measure the persuasiveness of preference-based generation.

        The AI Realtor framework automates the generation of persuasive marketing content through three key modules:

                    <h3>Grounding Module</h3>
                    <p>
                        This module predicts credible features for marketing by learning the attribute-feature mapping.
                        It transforms raw factual attributes (e.g., square footage, floor number) into marketable
                        features (e.g., "spacious layout", "bright room") by learning from human-written descriptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We constructed a high-quality feature schema and labeled dataset via a human-LLM collaborated
                        method (shown in the figure below) to train an
                        LLM that achieves $69.39\%$ testing accuracy in predicting which features should be
                        highlighted based on a property's attributes.

                    <h3>Personalization Module</h3>
                    <p>
                        This module aligns content with user preferences by eliciting user preferences and adjusting
                        feature selection accordingly. Instead of relying solely on machine learning, it uses a scoring
                        approach that balances feature validity with user preference ratings to select the most
                        appropriate features to emphasize for each individual user. The user elicitation interface is
                        shown below.

                    <p>
                        Inspired by marketing research showing that buyers derive entertainment utility from surprising
                        effects, this module identifies and highlights features that are relatively rare compared to
                        surrounding properties. It determines "surprising features" based on their percentile in the
                        feature distribution, giving LLMs localized feature information through Retrieval Augmented
                        Generation (RAG). We presented one user feedback on the surprising effect below. Personal

    <h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>
    <p>
        The research is underpinned by a micro-economic framework for automated marketing based on strategic
        communication theory. Check our our paper for more details. Key components include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Representation:</strong> A product $X$ is represented as an n-dimensional vector of raw
            attributes $X = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)$.</li>
        <li><strong>Signaling Features:</strong> Marketers emphasize attractive properties $S = (S_1, \cdots, S_m)$
            grounded in
            underlying raw attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Attribute-Feature Mapping:</strong> A mapping $\pi: \mathcal{X} \to [0,1]^m$ that maps product
            attributes to feature
            values.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing under Information Asymmetry:</strong> Revealing features to shift buyer beliefs from
            initial state to a more favorable perception.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evaluation and Results</h2>

    <h3>Human Feedback Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="figure">
        <div class="pdf-container" id="elo-container">
            <canvas id="elo-canvas"></canvas>
        </div>
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 3: Comparison of model performance using Elo ratings</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Systematic evaluation through human feedback shows that AI Realtor clearly outperforms both human experts and
        other model variants, measured by standard Elo ratings and win rates:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI Realtor achieved an Elo rating of $1315-1318$, compared to $947$ for human-written descriptions</li>
        <li>Each module enhancement progressively improved the persuasiveness of the generated content</li>
        <li>AI Realtor-generated descriptions have higher win rates against both human-written descriptions and vanilla
            LLM outputs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The human subjects in the experiment were asked to compare pairs of descriptions for the same property without
        knowing which was AI-generated and which was human-written. Each participant rated which description would make
        them more interested in the property, and by how much. We build a ChatArena-like interface to collect human
        feedback.

    <p>
        To explore the potential of scaling evaluation through AI simulation, the researchers employed an LLM to
        simulate the responses of buyers from previous experiments:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shot-wise Simulation Accuracy (SSA):</strong> The prediction accuracy averaged across users for each
            shot</li>
        <li><strong>User-wise Simulation Accuracy (USA):</strong> The prediction accuracy for each user, averaged across
            shots</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Key findings from the AI simulation experiment:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The model achieved $61.6\%$ accuracy across users and exhibited non-trivial (> $50\%$) performance for
            $79.2\%$ of
            users</li>
        <li>The variance in the USA metric was high and increased with more provided shots, highlighting challenges in
            personality simulation</li>
        <li>Error analysis attributed failures to several factors: Length Bias ($12.3\%$), Tie Comments ($19.8\%$),
            Emergent
            Preference ($25.3\%$), and Model Confusion ($4.3\%$)</li>
        <li>The findings suggest potential for AI feedback but highight current limitations in reliability for
            evaluation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hallucination Checks via Fact-Checking</h3>

    <div class="figure">

        </div>
        <div class="figure-caption">Figure 6: Faithfulness Scores for Different Models in Hallucination Checks</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        To ensure the generated content remained factually accurate, the researchers conducted fine-grained
        fact-checking tests:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Two types of factual attributes were checked:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>X<sub>hard</sub>:</strong> Attributes requiring complete accuracy (e.g., number of
                    bathrooms)</li>
                <li><strong>X<sub>soft</sub>:</strong> Attributes allowing rough accuracy (e.g., home address)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We computed two faithfulness metrics: <strong>Faithful<sub>hard</sub></strong> and
            <strong>Faithful<sub>soft</sub></strong> to measure accuracy
        </li>
        <li>AI Realtor descriptions were mostly faithful to listing information with minimal hallucination under both
            metrics</li>
        <li>Surprisingly, descriptions from human realtors and SFT models showed even higher levels of hallucination,
            particularly in vague descriptions of X<sub>hard</sub> attributes</li>
        <li>Example of human hallucination: <em>"This 4 bedroom, 3.5 bathroom home offers nearly <span
                    class="highlight-embellish">2,000</span> (<span class="highlight-actual">1,828</span>) sqft of
                living space..."</em></li>
        <li>AI Realtor tended to accurately describe factual attributes whenever mentioned, likely due to its preference
            to copy from context</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
